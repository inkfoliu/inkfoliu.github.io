Hello, my name is <b>Ying Ying</b>. I'm a final year undergraduate student in Psychology & Linguistics and an upcoming Master's student in Speech Sciences. My main areas of interest are in early speech perception, prosody & pragmatics, developmental psychology and psycholinguistics. I'm currently a research student at the McGill Language & Multilingualism Lab in the process of completing my thesis on cross-language syntactic activation and a research coordinator at the McGill Infant Speech Perception Lab. 

<h2>Random Fun Facts</h2>
<br>Trilingual and engages in code-mixing way too often.
<br>Easily amused by random things that other people don't find funny.
<br>Enjoys drawing and baking when I actually have time to human. 
<br>Has a neutral expression 90%+ of the time. (I'm actually friendly, I promise!)
